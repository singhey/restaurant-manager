# Drag and Drop Implementation Summary

## Task 7.1 - Set up @dnd-kit drag context and providers

### Completed Implementation:

#### 1. DragDropProvider Component
- **File**: `DragDropProvider.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Configured DndContext with mouse, keyboard, and touch sensors
  - Set up collision detection using `closestCenter`
  - Implemented drag overlay with item preview
  - Added conditional logic to disable drag-and-drop when alphabetical sorting is active
  - Handles drag start, drag over, and drag end events
  - Supports both category and subcategory reordering
  - Supports cross-category subcategory movement

#### 2. Updated Components

##### CategoryItem Component
- Added `useSortable` hook integration
- Added drag handle with `GripVertical` icon
- Disabled drag functionality when alphabetical sorting is active
- Added visual feedback during drag operations (opacity changes)
- Wrapped subcategories in `SortableContext`

##### SubcategoryItem Component  
- Added `useSortable` hook integration
- Added drag handle with `GripVertical` icon
- Disabled drag functionality when alphabetical sorting is active
- Added visual feedback during drag operations (opacity changes)

##### MenuStructurePanel Component
- Integrated `DragDropProvider` wrapper
- Added `SortableContext` for categories
- Connected drag handlers to placeholder functions (to be implemented in future tasks)

#### 3. Sensor Configuration
- **PointerSensor**: 8px activation distance to prevent accidental drags
- **TouchSensor**: 200ms delay and 8px tolerance for touch devices
- **KeyboardSensor**: Full keyboard navigation support with sortable coordinates

#### 4. Drag Data Structure
```typescript
interface DragData {
  type: 'category' | 'subcategory'
  id: string
  parentId?: string
  name: string
}
```

#### 5. Conditional Behavior
- When `isAlphabeticalSort` is true:
  - Drag handles are disabled and show "not-allowed" cursor
  - DragDropProvider renders children without DndContext
  - Visual indicators show disabled state
- When `isAlphabeticalSort` is false:
  - Full drag and drop functionality is enabled
  - Drag handles show grab cursor and are interactive

### Integration Points:
- Uses `useSortingPreference` hook to check alphabetical sorting state
- Placeholder handlers for actual reordering (to be implemented in task 7.2)
- Ready for integration with ZenStack mutation hooks

### Next Steps:
- Task 7.2: Implement actual category reordering with ZenStack hooks
- Task 7.3: Implement subcategory reordering with cross-category support
- Task 7.4: Add enhanced visual feedback and animations
