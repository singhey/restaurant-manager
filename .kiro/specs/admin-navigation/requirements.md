# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive navigation system for the admin application, consisting of a topbar and configurable sidebar navigation. The navigation will be integrated into the root layout using TanStack Router and will provide a consistent navigation experience across all admin pages. The design will follow a dark theme aesthetic similar to better-auth.com with proper highlighting of the current active page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want a consistent navigation layout with topbar and sidebar, so that I can easily navigate between different sections of the admin application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin application loads THEN the system SHALL display a topbar and sidebar navigation layout
2. WHEN navigating to any admin page THEN the system SHALL maintain the consistent navigation layout
3. WHEN viewing the navigation THEN the system SHALL apply a dark theme design consistent with better-auth.com styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the sidebar navigation to be configurable through a data structure, so that navigation items can be easily managed and updated without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar renders THEN the system SHALL load navigation items from a JSON file or JavaScript object
2. WHEN navigation configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reflect updates without requiring code modifications
3. WHEN displaying navigation items THEN the system SHALL support hierarchical menu structures with proper nesting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the current page to be visually highlighted in the navigation, so that I can easily identify my current location within the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating to a page THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding navigation item in the sidebar
2. WHEN the current route matches a navigation item THEN the system SHALL apply active styling to indicate selection
3. WHEN using nested routes THEN the system SHALL highlight both parent and child navigation items appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the navigation system integrated into the TanStack Router root layout, so that it appears consistently across all routes without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the navigation THEN the system SHALL integrate the layout into the __root.tsx file
2. WHEN routing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain navigation state and highlighting
3. WHEN new routes are added THEN the system SHALL automatically inherit the navigation layout

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the navigation to utilize the existing UI package sidebar component, so that the design remains consistent with the established component library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering the sidebar THEN the system SHALL use the sidebar component from the UI package
2. WHEN styling the navigation THEN the system SHALL leverage existing component props and styling options
3. WHEN the UI package updates THEN the system SHALL automatically inherit component improvements
