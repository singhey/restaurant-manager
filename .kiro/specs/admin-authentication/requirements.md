# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete authentication system for the admin application, including user registration, sign-in functionality, navigation integration, and session management. The system will leverage Better Auth for secure authentication handling and provide a seamless user experience with proper UI components and navigation states.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to register for a new account, so that I can access the admin application with my own credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to /auth/register THEN the system SHALL display a registration form with email, password, and confirm password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account using Better Auth
3. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard and establish an authenticated session
4. WHEN registration fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without clearing the form
5. IF a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them away from the registration page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to sign in to my existing account, so that I can access the admin application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to /auth/signin THEN the system SHALL display a sign-in form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using Better Auth and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
4. WHEN a user successfully signs in THEN the system SHALL establish an authenticated session
5. IF a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them away from the sign-in page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to see authentication options in the top navigation, so that I can easily access sign-in and registration when not authenticated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the top navigation SHALL display a "Sign In" button that navigates to /auth/signin
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Sign In" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the sign-in page
3. WHEN a user is on the sign-in page THEN there SHALL be a link to navigate to the registration page
4. WHEN a user is on the registration page THEN there SHALL be a link to navigate to the sign-in page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an authenticated admin user, I want to see my account options in the top navigation, so that I can manage my account or sign out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the top navigation SHALL display an account dropdown or menu
2. WHEN a user clicks the account menu THEN the system SHALL show options including "Account" and "Logout"
3. WHEN a user clicks "Logout" THEN the system SHALL sign them out using Better Auth and redirect to the sign-in page
4. WHEN a user clicks "Account" THEN the system SHALL navigate to an account management page
5. WHEN a user is signed out THEN the navigation SHALL immediately update to show the "Sign In" button

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the authentication forms to use consistent UI components, so that the interface feels cohesive with the rest of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication forms are displayed THEN they SHALL use Better Auth UI components for consistency
2. WHEN forms are rendered THEN they SHALL follow the existing design system and styling
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed using consistent error styling
4. WHEN forms are submitted THEN they SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want my authentication state to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to sign in repeatedly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in successfully THEN their session SHALL persist across browser restarts
2. WHEN a user's session expires THEN they SHALL be redirected to the sign-in page
3. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without authentication THEN they SHALL be redirected to sign-in
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the navigation SHALL update immediately to reflect the new state

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want a clean authentication experience without distracting navigation elements, so that I can focus on signing in or registering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the sign-in page THEN the sidebar SHALL be hidden from view
2. WHEN a user is on the sign-up page THEN the sidebar SHALL be hidden from view
3. WHEN a user navigates away from auth pages THEN the sidebar SHALL be visible again
4. WHEN the sidebar is hidden THEN the main content SHALL expand to use the full width
5. WHEN a user is on auth pages THEN only the sign-in and sign-up pages SHALL be accessible without authentication
